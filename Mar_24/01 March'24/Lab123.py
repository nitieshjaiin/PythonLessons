# File Handling
# How to read a text, and write into a file in a python code

# Function and Mode are used to read a file
# open("filename", "mode")
# First you need to check the mode
# Modes are as below:
# 'r' - for default (this is default mode)
# 'w' - for writing (creates a new file or truncates an existing one)
# 'a' - for appending.
# 'b' - for binary mode, example - vlc.exe is a binary file
# '+' - for updating (reading and writing)
# close the file

# read and write content
# read a file has multiple options as below:
# reading entire content: content = file_object.read()
# reading a line = file_object_readline() to read a single line
# reading multiple lines = file_object.readlines() for all lines in a file
